# SQL_Alchemy
I've decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with trip planning, I need to do some climate analysis on the area.

Climate analysis using SQLAlchemy (sqlite) & Flask data endpoints
Technology stack: Python, SQLAlchemy ORM, SQLite, Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask (JSON API endpoints)

Data Preparation
Climate data for Hawaii was provided in two CSV files. The content of these files was scrubbed.

Jupyter Notebook WeatherPy_w_comments.ipynb takes care of data preparation / cleanup tasks.
Pandas dataframes are created from the measurement and station CSV files.
NaNs / missing values are cleaned from the data, and cleaned CSV files are saved.

Database Engineering
Using SQLAlchemy to model database schema, sqlite tables for "measurements" and "stations" are created.

Jupyter Notebook WeatherPy_w_comments.ipynb used for database engineering work.
Pandas used to read cleaned measurements and stations CSV data.
Database called hawaii.sqlite created, using declarative_base to create ORM classes for each table, and used create_all to populate database.

Climate Analysis
Climate analysis and data exploration on new weather tables.

Jupyter Notebook file called VacationPy.ipynb used to complete climate analysis and data exporation.
Start date and end date determine "vacation" range.
Used SQLAlchemy create_engine to connect to sqlite database, and automap_base() to reflect tables into classes. Referenced those classes as Station and Measurement.

Precipitation analysis
Queries retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data, and results are plotted using matplotlib
Pandas dataframes house the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

Station analysis
Calculations of the total number of stations, and most active stations.
Retrieval of the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs), filtered by the station with the highest number of observations.
Plotted results as a histogram with bins=12.

Temperature analysis
Function calc_temps accepts a start date and end date in the format %Y-%m-%d, returns the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for that range of dates.
Function calculates min, avg, and max temperatures for trip using the matching dates from the previous year (i.e. use "2017-01-01" if trip start date was "2018-01-01")
Plotted the min, avg, and max temperature from previous query as a bar chart.
Used the average temperature as the bar height.
Used the peak-to-peak (tmax-tmin) value as the y error bar (yerr).

Flask Web Application
Flask web app with routes (endpoints) displaying JSON data results from each of the above queries.

Routes (API endpoints)
/api/v1.0/precipitation

Queries dates and temperature observations from the last year.
Converts query results to a dictionary using date as the key and tobs as the value.
Returns the json representation of dictionary.
/api/v1.0/stations

Returns a json list of stations from the dataset.
/api/v1.0/tobs

Returns a json list of temperature observations (tobs) for the previous year
/api/v1.0/<start> and /api/v1.0/<start>/<end>

Returns a json list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.
Given the start only, calculates TMIN, TAVG, and TMAX for all dates greater than and equal to the start date.
Given the start and the end date, calculates the TMIN, TAVG, and TMAX for dates between the start and end date inclusive.
